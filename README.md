# Quest manager

This mod is a cheat to complete a quest without having to fight. I created it because I didn't want to repeat the whole story again.

Please do not use it online, I'm not responsible for what might happen to you and you'll not have any honor

## Installation

1. Install [reframework](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/26)
2. Put the mod content inside reframework folder

## Usage

In a quest, Open reframework then go to: Script Generated UI > Quest Manager. All the monsters on the map are listed with some actions.

Normal quest:
- Kill : Slain the monster 
- Capture : Trigger the capture event and slain him (Can't do a real capture)
- Request go away : Request the monster to leave the map, it's not instantaneous

Rampage quest:
- Kill : Kill the monster to get rewards
- Force exit : Immediatly force the monster to exit
- 
*I didn't try SB yet, so I don't know if I need to manage other types of quest*

## Settings

- End quest time : Timer when the quest is completed
